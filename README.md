I have starting developing this web application few years back to learn PHP. Due to numerous reasons, I did not get time to work on it for more than a year. After a long break, I have just started working on this again. 

As you can see, the PHP that I have used on this are very basic right now. I have only used functions, everywhere. So, this time I am moving everything to use OOP. Basically, I am re-writing everything from scratch.

Some of the new features will be:
- OOP
- Organized folder structure
- API based
- PHP on Backend. AngularJS or ReactJS on frontend. I am still trying to decide on this. Any feedback is welcome.
I am adding some more features, and focusing on to make it more secure. 
-----------------------------
Any suggestions are welcome.
